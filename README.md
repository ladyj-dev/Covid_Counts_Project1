Covid Counts Findings


Your goal is to study how fatal Covid-19 is by age and gender and to determine if over time we have been able to treat and reduce death rates by percentage in California, New York, Texas and Virginia. The resource folder contains two csv files for your use from the healthdata.gov website. You'll need to explore, clean, and reformat your data before you can begin to answer your research questions. We recommend keeping track of the exploration and cleanup steps in a dedicated Jupyter Notebook, both for organization's sake and to make it easier to  present your work later. It may be useful to have a folder for each team member so you have easy access to the original coding to make changes since all of the code will not be able to be added to the final notebook. Additionally, if you are working in a group, work closely with your teammates and come to a general consensus and move forward to stay on track.


Before you start writing any code, your group should outline the scope and purpose of your project.


Write this as a brief summary of your interests and intent, including answering the following questions:


How fatal is Covid-19 to the young and old? This question is important to us in determining severity of cases and how to reopen during the pandemic.


How fatal is Covid-19 to men vs women? The role sex and gender are playing in the COVID-19 outbreak is essential to building an effective, equitable response to the pandemic.


Are the death percentages rising or falling as we treat COVID-19? The data overtime can help us analyze our response to the pandemic.


Make sure that your data is not too large for local analysis. Big Data datasets are difficult to manage locally, therefore four subsets of the country were randomly chosen to focus on.


Presentation:


After you've analyzed your data to your satisfaction, you'll put together a presentation to show off your work, explain your process, and discuss your conclusions.
This presentation will be delivered as a slideshow. Plan in advance to have a back up to present and make sure all documents are continually updated on git so everyone in the group has access.


*Celebrate your success and consider ways you can add to the research and dig even deeper.
